**Knowledge thus far**
EVA number is the unique trainstation number. This is crucial for the ongoing project.

cat means category and in this case is the reason for the delay (basically the terrible excuse)
ct is Changed time. Meaning newly estimated time.
l is line. 3 is S Bahn for example. Still investigating what other numbers such as 30 mean.
from and to are for the validity of a message. I am assuming this means after x amount of time the information is considered outdated?

The meaning of "c" is unknown. It states code but its unclear what this means.
